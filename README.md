CombatHelicopter2 decomp. & little RnD

## The preface

On the github on the "channel" of the WPR developer, I accidentally came across such an issue:

https://github.com/8212369/WPR/issues/44

I don't think I have the brains in my WPR fork to provide support for non-standard silverlight games. But in the 21st century, with the help of dotPeek reverse engineering and agent-based development environments like Trae, you can try to forget their WP7 games and UWP for Windows10Mobile, Windows 11 or XBox in an hour or two...

## Status

- Draft. Only "first" AI-reconstruction done (some decomp. errors automatically fixed approx. 1 hour of Trae IDE using...)
- Game runs in "Desktop" (Windows OS) successfully, but no mouse/kbd support at now. 

## ..
As is. Just for fun!
